== Context

You are responsible for following up on a development for which the
documentation is minimalist and the sources are available here:

https://github.com/codurance/task-list/tree/master/java

. Get the source codes of this project:
- either by cloning the rpeo:
+
..........
git clone https://github.com/codurance/task-list.git
..........
+
- or by directly downloading the https://github.com/codurance/task-list/archive/master.zip[.zip] file.
+
NOTE: Only the `java` folder is required. But feel free to have look at other languages.
+
. Launch the tests to check that everything is OK (`ApplicationTest.java`)
. Use this test code (see below) to determine what this application does and how it works.

== Refactoring

You have two weeks (week #17 and #18) to improve as much as possible this
application by:

- by "objectizing" the code (e.g., replacing primitive types by classes)
- applying good OO principles
- adding new features in the meantime (see below).

=== New features

You will choose among the following customer expectations (numbered for your
documentation, not to prioritize them):

. Deadlines
.. Each task can have a "deadline" (command example: `deadline <ID> <date>`).
.. The `today` command will allow you to see all the tasks whose deadline is
today.
. Removal
.. Allow the user to delete tasks (command example: `delete <ID>`).
. Visualizations
.. View the tasks by date (command example: `view by date`).
.. View tasks by deadline (command example: `view by deadline`).
.. Without changing the functionality that allows a user to see tasks by project,
change the command to `view by project`.
. Allow a task to "belong" to several projects at the same time
(if checked in one, checked in all for example)
. Ensure that the application permanently maintains 2 task lists per project: the "checked" and the "unchecked"
. (Be careful this one is tricky) Make sure that a task can be itself a task list

WARNING: Some of the features do not combine easily, and they are not equal in difficulty.

=== Types primitifs

If you have carefully observed the code, you will have noticed that it uses very little
of objects and on the other hand many primitive types (whole, tank, strings, collections, etc.).
Business concepts are weakly present (`task`,` project`, etc.).

Try, by implementing your new features, to get rid of primitive types as much as possible.

TIP: A good example to see if you focus on business concepts is
to verify that the primitive types are only used in the parameters of the
constructors, local variables or private attributes.
They should never be returned or passed as parameters to your methods (except for keyboard readings, etc.).

=== Good practices

Here are some (SOLID):

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
- **O**pen-Closed Principle
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle

TIP: Try to clearly identify in your documentation the principles implemented

== About tests

You will notice that the only test provided is a functional test.
It may be useful for you to verify that your application still respects
 the initial specifications. You can even enrich it to test
your new commands (like `view by ...`) work.

It does not exempt you to define
classic unit tests for the classes you are going to produce.

== Project expectations

=== Models

No model is mandatory, but do not hesitate to use them for your documentations.

By the way, here is the initial class diagramof the application:

=== Expected Deliverables

To allow some privacy in your work, you will not use the usual merge request protocol, but you will deposit by Sunday 03/05/2020 midnight two documents:

- A `.pdf` report containing (despite classical report elements such as
names, table of content, ...) a short explication about each additional feature and each refactoring decision with some code excerpts to illustrate these refactoring (before/after) and some justification.

WARNING: This report will be name Name1-Name2.pdf, with the name of the two members of the team.

- A `.zip` file containing your project with (at minimum) an `src` forlder with the source files and a `doc` folder containing the javadoc.

=== Evaluation criteria

You should work in teams of 2 max.

The main criteria that will guide the rating will be:

- relevance of the choices
- code quality
- quality of the report (illustration, explanations)
- extras (tests, models)

If necessary, do not hesitate to contact me (on Telegram or jbruel@gmail.com).
