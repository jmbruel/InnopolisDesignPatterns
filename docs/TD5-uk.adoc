TIP: Do not hesitate to (re)read regularly the {sitecours}.

== Motivations

In this exercise, we will explore the need to maintain consistency between related objects without making classes tightly coupled.

.The classical Observer illustration
image::observer-illustration.png[]

== The Observer design pattern

=== Definition

include::pattern/observer-uk.txt[]

Several precisions:

- the observers must be registered somehow
- the subject has to inform the observers (about changes).

.Example of use
image::observer-scenario2.png[]

There are several ways to implement the `attacher`, but in order to work properly
it must be done:

- by an external object,
- by the `concreteObserver` itself.

=== Intent

- Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

=== Applicability

Use the Observer pattern in any of the following situations:

- When an abstraction has two aspects, one dependent on the other.
Encapsulating these aspects in separate objects lets you vary and reuse
them independently.
- When a change to one object requires changing others
- When an object should be able to notify other objects without making
assumptions about those objects

=== Participants

* `Subject`
** Keeps track of its `observers`
** Provides an interface for attaching and detaching `Observer` objects
* `Observer`
** Defines an interface for update notification
* `ConcreteSubject`
** The object being observed
** Stores state of interest to ConcreteObserver objects
** Sends a notification to its observers when its state changes
* `ConcreteObserver`
** The observing object
** Stores state that should stay consistent with the subject's
** Implements the Observer update interface to keep its state consistent with
the subject's

=== Benefits

* Minimal coupling between the Subject and the Observer
-  Can reuse subjects without reusing their observers and vice versa
-  Observers can be added without modifying the subject
-  All subject knows is its list of observers
-  Subject does not need to know the concrete class of an observer, just that
each observer implements the update interface
-  Subject and observer can belong to different abstraction layers
* Support for event broadcasting
-  Subject sends notification to all subscribed observers
-  Observers can be added/removed at any time

=== Liabilities

* Possible cascading of notifications
- Observers are not necessarily aware of each other and must be careful
about triggering updates
* Simple update interface requires observers to deduce changed item

== Implementation Issues

=== Problems

Let's try to define an implementation.

TIP: If you already know or have used the `Observer` {java} implementation,
try to forget it!

//----------------------------- Question ------------------
.*QUESTION*
[WARNING]
====
Here are a list of possible issues. For each of them try to provide
some answers:

. How does the subject keep track of its observers?
. What if an observer wants to observe more than one subject?
. Who triggers the update?
. Make sure the subject updates its state before sending out notifications
. How much info about the change should the subject send to the observers?
. Can the observers subscribe to specific events of interest?
. Can an observer also be a subject?
. What if an observer wants to be notified only after several subjects have
changed state?
====

//----------------------------------------------------- Correction -------------------------
ifdef::prof[]
[icon="solution.png"]
[IMPORTANT]
.Solution
========

. Array, linked list
. Have the subject tell the observer who it is via the update interface
. For example:
- The subject whenever its state changes
- The observers after they cause one or more state changes
- Some third party object(s)
. Hard to enforce other than by systematic checking/testing
. For example:
- Push Model => Lots
- Pull Model => Very Little
. If so, it's publish-subscribe
. Yes!
. For example:
- Use an intermediary object which acts as a mediator
- Subjects send notifications to the mediator object which performs any
necessary processing before notifying the observers

=== _Observer_ in Java

{Java} provides the _Observable/Observer_ classes as built-in
support for the _Observer_ pattern.
The `java.util.Observable` class is the base `Subject` class.
Any class that wants to be observed extends this class which:

- Provides methods to add/delete observers
- Provides methods to notify all observers
- A subclass only needs to ensure that its observers are notified in the
appropriate mutators
- Uses a `Vector` for storing the observer references

The `java.util.Observer` interface is the `Observer` interface.
It must be implemented by any observer class.

==== The java.util.Observable Class

//----------------------------- Question ------------------

[WARNING]

Here is a list of methods of the `java.util.Observable` class:

[source,java,linenum]
-----
public Observable()
public synchronized void addObserver(Observer o)
protected synchronized void setChanged()
public synchronized void deleteObserver(Observer o)
protected synchronized void clearChanged()
public synchronized boolean hasChanged()
public void notifyObservers(Object arg)
public void notifyObservers()
-----

Match them with their corresponding comments:

. Adds an observer to the set of observers of this object
. If this object has changed, as indicated by the hasChanged() method, then
notify all of its observers and then call the clearChanged() method to
indicate that this object has no longer changed. Each observer has its
update() method called with two arguments: this observable object and the
arg argument. The arg argument can be used to indicate which attribute of
the observable object has changed.
. Indicates that this object has changed
. Indicates that this object has no longer changed, or that it has already
notified all of its observers of its most recent change. This method is called
automatically by `notifyObservers()`.
. Same as above, but the arg argument is set to null. That is, the observer is
given no indication what attribute of the observable object has changed.
. Tests if this object has changed. Returns true if setChanged() has been
called more recently than clearChanged() on this object; false otherwise.
. Construct an `Observable` with zero observers
. Deletes an observer from the set of observers of this object

=== Limitations of Observable/Observer in Java

Problem::
Suppose the class which we want to be an observable is already part of an
inheritance hierarchy, e.g.,:

[source,java,linenum]
------
class SpecialSubject extends ParentClass
------

//----------------------------- Question ------------------
.*QUESTION*
[WARNING]
====
Since {Java} does not support multiple inheritance, how can we have
`ConcreteSubject` extend both `Observable` and `ParentClass` ?

. Propose a solution
. Define its corresponding class diagram
. Write the {java} implementations (mainly `SpecialSubject`)
+
TIP: Two methods of `java.util.Observable` are *protected* methods: `setChanged()`
and `clearChanged()`.

You can use the following test code:
[source,java]
-----
// Test program for SpecialSubject with a Delegated Observable.
public class TestSpecial {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    // Create the Subject and Observers.
    SpecialSubject s = new SpecialSubject("Corn Pops", 1.29f);
    NameObserver nameObs = new NameObserver();
    PriceObserver priceObs = new PriceObserver();
    // Add those Observers!
    s.getObservable().addObserver(nameObs);
    s.getObservable().addObserver(priceObs);
    // Make changes to the Subject.
    s.setName("Frosted Flakes");
    s.setPrice(4.57f);
    s.setPrice(9.22f);
    s.setName("Sugar Crispies");
  }
}
-----

That should produce the following results:

.......
ConcreteSubject created: Corn Pops at 1.29
NameObserver created: Name is null
PriceObserver created: Price is 0.0
PriceObserver: Some other change to subject!
NameObserver: Name changed to Frosted Flakes
PriceObserver: Price changed to 4.57
PriceObserver: Price changed to 9.22
PriceObserver: Some other change to subject!
NameObserver: Name changed to Sugar Crispies
.......

.Solution
========
. Here is one solution:
- Use Delegation
- We will have `SpecialSubject` contain an `Observable` object
- We will delegate the observable behavior that `SpecialSubject` needs to this
contained `Observable` object
. Corresponding class diagram
+
image::specialsubject.png[]
+
. Corresponding {java} code:

[source,java,linenum]
------
/**
 * A subject to observe!
 * But this subject already extends another class.
 * So use a contained DelegatedObservable object.
 * Note that in this version of SpecialSubject we do
 * not duplicate any of the interface of Observable.
 * Clients must get a reference to our contained
 * Observable object using the getObservable() method.
 */
import java.util.Observable;

public class SpecialSubject extends ParentClass {
   private String name;
   private float price;
   private DelegatedObservable obs;

   public SpecialSubject(String name, float price) {
     this.name = name;
     this.price = price;
     obs = new DelegatedObservable();
     System.out.println("ConcreteSubject created: " + name + " at " + price);
   }
   public String getName() {return name;}
   public float getPrice() {return price;}
   public Observable getObservable() {return obs;}
   public void setName(String string) {
     name = string;
     obs.setChanged();
     obs.notifyObservers(name);
   }
   public void setPrice(float f) {
     price = f;
     obs.setChanged();
     obs.notifyObservers(price);
   }
}
------

Explanations:

What's this `DelegatedObservable` class?
It implements the two methods of `java.util.Observable` that are protected methods:
`setChanged()` and `clearChanged()`.

NOTE: Apparently, the designers of Observable felt that only subclasses
of Observable (that is, "true" observable subjects) should be able
to modify the state-changed flag.

If `SpecialSubject` contains an `Observable` object, it could not
invoke the `setChanged()` and `clearChanged()` methods on it.
So we have `DelegatedObservable` extends `Observable` and override
these two methods making them have public visibility.

NOTE: {Java} rule: A subclass can changed the visibility of an overridden
method of its superclass, but only if it provides more access.

After studying the solution with your favorite teacher:

. Do you see a problem to this implementation?
. Can you provide a solution?
====
//----------------------------------------------------- Correction -------------------------
ifdef::prof[]
[icon="solution.png"]
[IMPORTANT]
.Solution
========
. The problem: this version of `SpecialSubject` did not provide implementations
of any of the methods of `Observable`. As a result, it had to allow
its clients to get a reference to its contained `Observable` object
using the `getObservable()` method. This may have dangerous
consequences. A rogue client could, for example, call the
`deleteObservers()` method on the `Observable` object, and delete all
the observers!
Let’s have `SpecialSubject` not expose its contained `Observable`
object, but instead provide "wrapper" implementations of the
`addObserver()` and `deleteObserver()` methods which simply pass
on the request to the contained `Observable` object.
. The solution

    this.price = price;
    obs = new DelegatedObservable();
  }
  public String getName() {return name;}
  public float getPrice() {return price;}
